## POST (create) and PUT (update)

You can post or put data by querying the following URL:

* **(POST or PUT) http://my-shop-url/api/propertyGroups/id**

| Field               | Type                  | Original Object			                                |

## DELETE
To delete a property group, simply query this URL with a `DELETE` request:

* **http://my-shop-url/api/propertyGroups/id**

Replace the `id` with the specific property group id.

## DELETE (Stack)

In order to delete more than one cache at once, it's possible to provide an array of ids to the REST API.
Simply pass the array of cache ids to the following URL (example)

* **[DELETE] http://my-shop-url/caches/**

without providing an id as seen in the single `DELETE` request. As data provide the array of ids you wish to delete.
