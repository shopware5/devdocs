## Introduction
Shopware 5.1 comes with an useful feature which is specially interesting for developers who would love to create a backend module for their plugin, but don't want to deal with the steep learning curve of ExtJS. In the following article you'll get to know this new technology.

## Concept
The basic idea behind the lightweight backend modules is quite simple: we want to allow third party developers to create simple backend modules in a breeze. Therefore, we want to come up with a solution which allows creating the modules using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript, without the headache of learning ExtJS.

This means we have to encapsulate the module from the rest of the Shopware backend, using an `iframe` element, which includes the module content.

Due to the fact that the `iframe` element is basically a website in another website, we had to find a way to communicate with the `iframe` and, on the other hand, the `iframe` needs a way to communicate with the backend as well.

### HTML5's cross document messaging

In the [HTML5 Web Messaging Draft](https://w3c.github.io/webmessaging/#web-messaging) a new API called `Window.postMessage()` was introduced, which safely enables cross-origin communication using a defined message bus. It gives the recipient of a message a reliable way to know its real origin. The current HTML5 specification allows the payload to be either a string or a JavaScript object. In either case, there's no message structure semantics built into the specification, which means there's no standard way to handle the message's payload and process the message.

### Message structure

We're using the `Window.postMessage` API for the inter-process communication between module content and the rest of the backend. We overcome the missing message structure with another established standard protocol named [JSON-RPC 2.0](http://www.jsonrpc.org). It is a stateless, lightweight remote procedure call protocol encoded in `JSON`. The general mechanism consists of two peers establishing a data connection. During the lifetime of a connection, peers may invoke methods provided by the other peer.

## The communication layer
As mentioned above, we're using [JSON-RPC 2.0](http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) for the communication. We extended the specification with several modifications to support our use case. A RPC call is represented by sending a Request object to a Server, with the following content by default.

```js
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"method": "substract",
	"params": [42, 23],
	"id": 1
}
```

Our modification of the Request objects contains additional information about the module (`instance`) and window (`component`) which sent the Request to Server. The `target` member defines the Shopware modules containing the method which should be called. Due to the asynchronous nature of JavaScript, the Request object contains an `async` member. The member defines that the result isn't available immediately after the method is called, but rather once the callback of the called method is invoked.

```js
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"method": "createSubWindow",
	"params": { "name": "Custom window" },
	"target": "Shopware.ModuleManager",
	"component": "main",
	"instance": "550e8400-e29b-11d4-a716-446655440000",
	"async": true,
	"id": 1
}
```

The Response object contains the result of the called method and has the following members:

```js
{
	"jsonrpc": "2.0",
	"result": [ "some": "data" ],
	"error": null,
	"component": "main",
	"instance": "550e8400-e29b-11d4-a716-446655440000",
	"id": 1
}
```

A response will always be sent from the Server to the Client which sent the Request object. The `result` member can be `null` if an error occurred on the Server and the value of this member should have been determined by the method invoked on the Server. Please keep in mind that the entire inter-process communication is asynchronous, therefore the processing of the Response object has to be handled in a callback method.

## How to create a simple backend module?
Creating a new backend module using the lightweight backend module is super easy. Basically you just have to create a new menu entry in the Shopware administration and register a backend controller to get it working. Let's start with the menu entry. In our plugin install method we call the method `$this->createMenuItem()` to add the new entry:

```php
public function install()
{
    try {
        $this->registerBackendController();
        $this->createMenu();
        return array(
            'success' => true,
            'invalidateCache' => array('backend')
        );

    } catch (Exception $e) {
        return array('success' => false, 'message' => $e->getMessage());
    }
}
```

Now let's implement the actual menu entry:

```php
$this->createMenuItem(array(
    'label' => 'PlainHTML Modul',
    'onclick' => 'createSimpleModule("ExampleModulePlainHtml", { "title": "Plain HTML Module" })',
    'class' => 'sprite-star',
    'active' => 1,
    'parent' => $this->Menu()->findOneBy(['label' => 'Einstellungen'])
));
```

Please note that we call the `createSimpleModule()` JavaScript method in the `onclick` property of the menu entry, which means that, when the user clicks on the menu entry, the `onclick` method will be called and the backend module will be create. The first argument of the `createSimpleModule()` is the name of the backend controller and the second argument is an object to customize the appearance of the window. You can set the title, width and / or height of the window.

### Registering a custom backend controller

The next step is to register the new backend controller in the `Bootstrap.php` file of your plugin. In the example 
below, we do that in the `registerBackendController()` method by calling `registerController()`:

```php
function registerBackendController()
{
	$this->registerController(
	    'Backend',
	    'ExampleModulePlainHtml'
	);
}
```

Okay, our custom backend controller is registered in the application, now we can implement the controller. Please note we already registered our template directory in the `onGetBackendController()` event handler method.

The minimum requirement for the controller is that it extends from `Enlight_Controller_Action` and has the `indexAction` method implemented. The actual function body of the method can be left empty.

```php
class Shopware_Controllers_Backend_ExampleModulePlainHtml extends Enlight_Controller_Action {
    public function indexAction() {

    }
}
```

### Layout your module

<div class="alert alert-warning">
We strongly recommend using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> with our backend inspired theme to get the look and feel of the shopware backend.

Check it out: <a href="https://github.com/shopwareLabs/bootstrap-theme-shopware" target="_blank">Bootstrap Shopware Backend Theme</a>
</div>

Now let's start templating our backend module. We recommend using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) as the frontend framework. First let's take a look on the directory structure in the `Views/backend` directory of our plugin:

```bash
|-- _base
|   `-- layout.tpl
|-- _resources
|   |-- css
|   |   |-- bootstrap-theme.min.css
|   |   `-- bootstrap.min.css
|   |-- fonts
|   `-- js
|       |-- bootstrap.min.js
|       `-- jquery-2.1.4.min.js
`-- example_module_plain_html
    `-- index.tpl
```

As you can see there's a file called `_base/layout.tpl`. It's best practice to create a basic layout file which contains the HTML head and the necessary structure for you module. The block system of [Smarty](http://www.smarty.net/) from the storefront is also available in your backend module, therefore it's recommend to create your own Smarty blocks in the `_base/layout.tpl`. Here's an example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{link file="backend/_resources/css/bootstrap.min.css"}">
    
    {block name="content/header_tags"}{/block}
</head>
<body role="document" style="padding-top: 80px">

<!-- Fixed navbar -->
<nav class="navbar navbar-inverse navbar-fixed-top">
	{block name="content/navigation"}{/block}
</nav>

<div class="container theme-showcase" role="main">
    {block name="content/main"}{/block}
</div> <!-- /container -->

<script type="text/javascript" src="{link file="backend/base/frame/postmessage-api.js"}"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="{link file="backend/_resources/js/jquery-2.1.4.min.js"}"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="{link file="backend/_resources/js/bootstrap.min.js"}"></script>
{block name="content/javascript"}{/block}
</body>
</html>
```

The only requirement is to import `backend/base/frame/postmessage-api.js`. This file provides the postMessage API, which initializes itself and connects to the Shopware backend. 


## postMessage API
Our postMessage API is event-driven and uses an [observer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) to provide an easy way to extend its native functionality. Every method fires an event, which can be used to hook your own logic into the API. One of the most important events is the `initialized-api`, which lets you know that the API is ready for further usage. Here's an example of how to use events:

```
var subscription = window.events.subscribe('initialized-api', function(obj) {
    // Do something now that the event has occurred
});

// ...sometime later where I no longer want subscription...
subscription.remove();
```

Here's a entire list of all available events:

* send-rpc-request-object
* initialized-api
* get-post-message
* open-module
* open-subwindow
* send-message-to-subwindow
* create-growl-message
* create-confirm-message
* create-prompt-message
* create-alert-message
* set-title
* component/get-width
* component/set-width
* component/get-height
* component/set-height
* component/show
* component/hide
* component/destroy
* component/minimize
* component/maximize
* component/restore
* component/toggle-maximize
* component/set-body-style
