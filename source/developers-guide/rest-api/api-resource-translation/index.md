## DELETE
To delete a shop, simply call this URL with the `DELETE` request:

* **http://my-shop-url/api/translations/id**

Replace the `id` with the specific translation id.

## DELETE (Stack)

In order to delete more than one translation at once, it's possible to provide an array of ids to the REST API.
Simply pass the array of translation ids to the following URL (example)

* **[DELETE] http://my-shop-url/translations/**

without providing an id as seen in the single `DELETE` request. As data provide the array of ids you wish to delete.

## PUT (update) (Stack)

Updating many articles at once requires an array of translation data being provided to the following URL using the `PUT` request (example):

* **[PUT] http://my-shop-url/translations/**

Simply provide the same data as described in the `GET` request. Unlike other batch endpoints, a "key" field is required instead of an "id" field.
