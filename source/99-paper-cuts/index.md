## What is the 99 Papercut Project?

**As an open source project, Shopware’s strength is attributed to the feedback and involvement from our vibrant Community. So in honor of this philosophy, we created the project “99 Papercuts” to encourage your direct involvement in making Shopware the best possible eCommerce software for your needs. 

In the first phase of the project, we asked for your suggestions on how Shopware could be tweaked and made even better. To make this project a huge success, we need the added manpower from your contributions in this second phase.**

## Get involved in making Shopware an even better solution!
