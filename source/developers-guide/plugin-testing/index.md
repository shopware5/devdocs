## Unit tests
If you want to start writing a new plugin keep in mind that unit testing helps you to deliver higher quality plugins.
With help of the __cli tools__ you can easily start with plugin skeleton which has all relevant snippets to start directly with
testing. One of the first things that is important for testing is a `phpunit.xml[.dist]`. It could look like this:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<phpunit bootstrap="./tests/Bootstrap.php">
<testsuite name="MyPlugin Test Suite">
    <directory>tests</directory>
</testsuite>
</phpunit>
```

### Basics
The starting point for testing your own plugin ist the __phpunit.xml[.dist]___ and the `Bootstrap.php` file in the `\tests` folder
of your plugin.

With the `Bootstrap.php` you can setup your environment properly to prepare it for testing. You can __initialize the kernel__, register __event subscribers__ and __namespaces__ or
you could initialize the __shop context__ to make currencies available. To prepare your plugin for testing it is necessary to require the Shopware helper bootstrap.
 ```php
 <?php
 
 require __DIR__ . '/../../../../tests/Bootstrap.php';
 ```
 <div class="alert alert-warning">
 The path to this file depends on wheter you are using the <b>legacy plugin system</b> or the <b>new 5.2 Plugin system</b>.
 </div>
 The helper bootstrap starts the testing kernel and makes
 several functions like `Shopware()` available for you. You can then use the __service container__.
 
 ### Writing tests
 
 You can then place your test which could look like this:
 ```php
 <?php
 
 class CalculatorTest extends Shopware\Components\Test\Plugin\TestCase
 {
     protected static $ensureLoadedPlugins = array(
         'MyPlugin' => [
             'some_config' => 'foo'
         ]
     );
 
     public function testMyService()
     {
         $service = new MyService();
         $result = $service->add(1, 1);
 
         $this->assertEquals(2, $result);
     }
 }
 ```
You can run this test from your plugin folder by typing `phpunit` if you have installed phpunit globally. Otherwise you could use the onboard
phpunit version shopware comes with.

With help of the `$ensureLoadedPlugins` static you can assure that your plugin is installed and activated and you can even configure it. It is not required
to assure that and the less your test needs the __Shopware stack__, the better the test is written.

We have written a tiny example plugin just to show how you could start testing your work.
