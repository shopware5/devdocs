## Introduction
The javascript development can be painful especially when you have to deal on responsive websites where you have to adjust the behavior of the code based on the available screen real estate. Therefore we came up with a component called *StateManager*, which provides you with the ability to define states and triggers *callback* function, if a state was entered or left.

On the other hand we have our lovely jQuery plugins which are not always a pleasure to built. To simplify the process we implemented a plugin base class which features the best practices of the jQuery plugin development and flawlessly integrate with the *StateManager*.

In the following document we want to give you a general overview of the provided functionality, which can come in handy for your next theme.

## Plugin base class
As mentioned, the jQuery plugin base class was built up with the best practice of the jQuery plugin development. Here's feature set at a glance:

* Default configuration + ability to override it with a user configuration
* Ability to use HTML5 ```data``` attributes to configure the plugin
* Support for jQuery's method chaining
* Namespacing of events
* Built-in functionality to remove event listeners
* Preventing multiple instanciation on the same element
* Custom expression to check if an element uses a specific plugin
* Automatically binding the plugin to the element using jQuery's ```data```-method

As you can see, we put a lot of effort in the provided feature set to provide you an easy to use class for your next jQuery plugin.

### Getting started
Now it's time to take a look on the actual implementation process of a jQuery plugin using the plugin base class. Here's a commented example of a generic plugin:

```javascript
/**
 * Example jQuery plugin using the base class
 *
 * The $.plugin method binded to the globally available jQuery
 * object. The method needs two parameters, the first one is
 * simply the name of the plugin which will be used to bind
 * the plugin to jQuery's $.fn namespace. The second parameter
 * is a object which provides the default configuration and 
 * the actucal implementation of the plugin.
 */
$.plugin('example', {
    
    /**
     * The default configuration object of the plugin. The
     * user can provide custom settings which will be automatically
     * merged into a new object which can be accessed using "this.opts"
     * in any plugin method which scope is on the plugin.
     */
    defaults: {
        activeCls: 'js--is-active'
    },
    
    /**
     * The "init" method acts like a constructor for the plugin.
     * Usually you'll cache necessary elements and registers the
     * event listeners for your plugin. Additionally you can switch
     * up the behavior of the plugin based on the provided configuration.
     */
    init: function() {
        var me = this;
        
        /**
         * Calling the "applyDataAttributes" method the base class
         * automatically reads out the all "data" attributes from
         * the element and overrides the configuration. It's especially
         * useful if you want to configure your plugin using the HTML
         * markup instead of providing a configuration object.
         *
         * For example, we call this plugin on the following element:
         *    <div data-activeCls="some-other-class">...</div>
         *
         * ... the "data" attribute will override the "activeCls"
         * property with the value "some-other-class".
         */
        me.applyDataAttributes();
        
        /**
         * Now we're setting up a new event listener for the plugin
         * using the built-in "_on" method which is actually a proxy
         * method for jQuery's "on" method with some additional benefits.
         * The event listener and the event will be registered in a
         * plugin specific event collection. The collection will be 
         * automatically iterated and removes the registered event listeners
         * from the element.
         * Additionally the event name will be namespaced on the fly which
         * provides us with a safe way to remove a specific event listener from
         * an element and doesn't affect other plugins which are listening on
         * the same event. 
         */
        me._on(me.$el, 'click', function(event) {
            event.preventDefault();
            
            /**
             * In the condition we're using the custom expression of the plugin
             * to terminate if the element uses our plugin.
             * Additionally you see that we're using the variable "this.$el" which
             * is the element that has instanciated the plugin.
             */
            if(me.$el.is('plugin-example')) {
                
                /**
                 * Now we're accessing the merged configuration of the plugin using
                 * the variable "this.opts".
                 */
                me.$el.toggleClass(me.opts.activeCls);
            }
        });
    },
    
    /**
     * The destroy method can either be called programmically from outside the plugin
     * or automatically using the "StateManager" when the defined states are left.
     * Usually you remove classes which were added by your plugin to the element and
     * removes the event listeners from the element.
     */
    destroy: function() {
        var me = this;
    
        me.$el.removeClass(me.opts.activeCls);
        
        /**
         * Calling the "_destroy" method will remove all event listeners which were
         * registered using the "_on" method of the plugin base.
         * You can access the collection of the events in the plugin using the variable
         * "this._events" if you wanna iterate over the event listeners yourself.
         */
        me._destroy();
    }
});
```
*Fully commented jQuery plugin using the base class.*

### Class properties
* ```_name : String```
	* Name of the plugin. 
* ```$el : jQuery```
	* The HTMLElement which instanciated the plugin as a jQuery object.
* ```opts : Object```
	* Result of the default configuration and the provides user configuration. Keep in mind that calling the ```this.applyDataAttributes()``` method overrides the property values in the object.
* ```_events : Array```
	* Collection, which contains all registered event listener which are added using the ```_on``` method.
	
### Class methods
* ```init()```
	* Template method which acts as the constructor of the plugin where you can cache the necessary HTML elements and set up the event listeners.
* ```destroy()```
	* Template method which destroyes the plugin. Usually you remove classes and event listeners which you're added to the element. The method should be implemented in your plugin especially when you plan to provide the plugin functionality only for certain states.
* ```update()```
	* Template method which will be called when a certain state was entered / left to update the behavior of the plugin. This method is only necessary when you use the StateManager to instanciate the plugin.
* ```_destroy()```
	* Private method which iterates over the registered event listeners in the ```_events``` property of the plugin. Additionally the method removes the in-memory binding of the plugin to the element using the jQuery's ```removeData()``` method and fires an event on the globally available observer.
* ```_on()```
	* **Arguments**
		* ```element : jQuery | HTMLElement``` - The event target for the specified event listener.
		* ```event : String``` - A string representing the event type to listen for.
		* ```fn : Function``` - The object that receives a notification when an event of the specified type occurs.
	* Proxy method for jQuery's ```on()``` method which binds an event listener to the provided element and registers the listener in the ```_events``` event collection.
* ```_off()```
	* **Arguments**
		* ```element : jQuery | HTMLElement``` - The event target which has an event listener
		* ```event : String``` - One or more space-separated event types and optional namespaces, or just namespaces, such as "click" or "keydown.myPlugin"
* ```getName()```
	* Getter method for the plugin name.
* ```getEventName()```
	* **Arguments**
		* ```event : String | Array``` - One or more space-separated event types
	* Applies the event namespace to the provided event types.
* ```getElement()```
	* Getter method for the element which instanciate the plugin.
* ```getOptions()```
	* Getter method for the merged configuration object.
* ```getOption()```
	* **Arguments**
		* ```key : String``` - Key of the configuration property
	* Getter method for a certain configuration property
* ```setOption()```
	* **Arguments**
		* ```key : String``` - Key of the configuration property
		* ```value : Mixed``` - Value for the provided key
	* Setter method which overrides the value of the provided key with the provided value.
* ```applyDataAttributes()```
	* Fetches the provided configuration keys and overrides the values based on the elements ```data``` attributes.
	
## Global jQuery event observer

We added a global event server into Shopware 5 too. It provides us with the ability to define events globally on the jQuery object and therefor every plugin can listen to this events:

```javascript
// Register new event
$.publish('plugin/some-plugin/onInit', me);

// Listen for an event
$.subscribe('plugin/some-plugin/onInit', function() {
	console.log('onInit');
})

// Remove event listener
$.unsubscribe('plugin/some-plugin/onInit');
```

Please keep in mind to register your event listeners with a namespace, otherwise you'll remove all subscribed event listeners for the certain event type.

```javascript
$.subscribe('plugin/some-plugin/onInit.my-plugin', function() {});

// Remove event listener
$.unsubscribe('plugin/some-plugin/onInit.my-plugin');
```

	
## The state manager
The state manager helps you master different behaviors for different screen sizes.
It provides you with the ability to register different states that are handled
by breakpoints.

Those breakpoints are defined by entering and exiting points (in pixels)
based on the viewport width.
By entering the breakpoint range, the ```enter()``` functions of the registered
listeners are called.
When the defined points are reached, the registered ```exit()``` listener
functions will be called.

This way you can register callbacks that will be called on entering / exiting the defined state.

The manager provides you multiple helper methods and polyfills which help you
master responsive design.

## Using the state manager
The state manager is self-containing and globally available in the global javascript scope in the storefront.

It has been initialized with the following breakpoints:

* State XS
	* Range between ```0``` and ```479``` pixels
	* Usually used for smartphones in portrait mode
* State S
	* Range between ```480``` and ```767``` pixels
	* Usually used for smartphones in landscape mode
* State M
	* Range between ```768``` and ```1023``` pixels
	* Usually used for tablets in portrait mode
* State L
	* Range between ```1024``` and ```1259``` pixels
	* Usually used for tablets in landscape mode, netbooks and desktop PCs
* State XL
	* Range between ```1260``` and ```5160``` pixels
	* Usually used for desktop PCs with a high resolution monitor

### Adding an event listener
Registering or removing an event listener which uses the state manager is as easy as doing it in pure javascript.

The following example shows how to register an event listener:

```javascript
StateManager.registerListener([{
	state: 'xs',
	enter: function() { console.log('onEnter'); },
	exit: function() { console.log('onExit'); }
}]);
```

The registration of event listeners also supports wildcards, so the ```enter()``` and ```exit()``` methods are called by every change of the breakpoint:

```javascript
StateManager.registerListener([{
	state: '*',
	enter: function() { console.log('onEnter'); },
	exit: function() { console.log('onExit'); }
}]);
```


### Register additional breakpoints
The default breakpoints can be extended using the ```registerBreakpoint()``` method of the StateManager.  
**Note:** Breakpoint ranges are not allowed to overlap with other existing ones.

```javascript
StateManager.registerBreakpoint({
	state: 'xxl',
	enter: 78.75  // = 1260px
	exit: 90      // = 1440px
});
```

### Class methods
* ```init()```
	* **Arguments**

		* ```softError : Boolean``` - Truthy to return the provided property when no vendor was found, otherwise the method returns ```null```
	* Tests the provided CSS style property on an empty div with all vendor properties.

## Working with stateful jQuery plugins
The combination of the StateManager paired with the jQuery plugin base class provides an easy-to-use way to register jQuery plugins for certain state. That provides us with the ability to provide a different behavior of components based on the current active state. For example the Offcanvas menu plugin is only active on mobile devices (states "xs" and "s") and is disabled on tablets and desktop pc's.

The state manager is available in the global javascript scope of the storefront. To register your plugin, simply can call the addPlugin() method of the state manager.

In the following example we register our own jQuery plugin for the XS and S states. The name of the plugin is "myPlugin" and we will bind it to the HTML DOM nodes which have the class .my-selector:

```javascript
StateManager.addPlugin('.my-selector', 'myPlugin', [ 'xs', 's' ]);
```

### Passing a user configuration to the jQuery plugin
It's also possible to pass user configuration options to the plugin, which will be merged with the plugin's default configuration. The merged configuration is accessible using the this.opts object in your plugin.

```javascript
// your plugin
$.plugin('myPlugin', {
    defaults: {
        'speed': 300
    }
});

// Registration of the plugin
StateManager.addPlugin('.my-selector', 'myPlugin', {
    'speed': 2000
}, [ 'xs', 's' ]);
```

If you need to pass a modified configuration to your plugin for a specific viewport, you can use the following pattern:

```javascript
StateManager.addPlugin('.my-selector', 'myPlugin', {
    'speed': 300
}).addPlugin('.my-selector', 'myPlugin', {
    'speed': 2000
}, 's');
```

	
## Adding javascript files to your theme
Working with compressors isn't always as easy as adding the files to your HTML structure using ```script``` tags. The built-in javascript compressor is as easy as this and perfectly suited your workflow as a web developer.

Simply place your javascript files in the ```frontend/_public``` directory and add their paths to the ```$javascript``` array in your ```Theme.php```, and you're good to go.

```php
/** @var array Defines the files which should be compiled by the javascript compressor */
protected $javascript = array(
	'src/js/jquery.my-plugin.js'
);
```
