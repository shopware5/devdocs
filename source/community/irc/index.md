## The shopware IRC channel is discontinued

*It is replaced by Gitter.* Please use <a href="{{ site.url }}/community/gitter">this guide</a> to connect and (re)join the awesome shopware community via chat!

## Why was  IRC discontinued?

Since 2011, the shopware IRC channel was active and well established.     
Today, IRC is a little bit nerdy and we really love it. Most of the cool kids are playing on freenode.

But besides the coolness there are a few disadvantages that come with using IRC:

- No history without 3rd party software
- No mapping between the contributor and the IRC nick (Who is xenomorph again?)
- No easy access except through anonymous web IRC clients
- Lacks modern features like image sharing, formatting and such

Of course, all these points are arguable.    
But in the end, we wanted to have a chat community with easier access and more modern features.

We hope to not lose any old IRC users (we learned to love you all at #shopware) and get many new and interesting people to join <a href="{{ site.url }}/community/gitter">Gitter</a>.

## "But I don't want to use Gitter! In fact, I hate it!"

Don't worry, we've got you covered.

There is an official bridge you can use to connect via IRC: [gitterHQ/irc-bridge](https://github.com/gitterHQ/irc-bridge) (you can host your own version if you want to).

You need to get a token, which you can obtain from [irc.gitter.im](https://irc.gitter.im/), and if you need help configuring there are some [guides](https://github.com/gitterHQ/irc-bridge/wiki/Client-configuration) for that.

Remember how we stated we love our IRC users? We do, indeed. Including you. <3
