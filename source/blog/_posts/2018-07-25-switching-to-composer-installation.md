In this blog post you will learn how to change your Shopware classic installation to the composer installation. I already mentioned it in the shopware [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUME-FnlUKE) (a format you should know ;-) ).

The requirements are very easy to fulfill. We need Shopware in the latest Version of 5.4. Nothing more.

### Clean up classic installation
So let's start. Please go into the shopware root directory and delete some files and directories which are no longer needed from the classic installation: 
```bash 
rm -rv bin recovery vendor composer.* shopware.php
```

### Create composer installation

Now we create a new composer project with the following command: 

```bash
composer create-project shopware/composer-project composer-installation \ 
    --no-interaction --stability=dev
```
You should receive an error message like the following because we didn't create a .env file: 

```bash
Could not load .env file
Script ./app/post-update.sh handling the post-update-cmd event returned with error code 1
```

### Merge classic and composer installation

The command creates a new directory composer-installation wich contains all needed files for our composer installation. After that we have to move some files and directories stored in the new directory a level up with this commands:
```bash
mv composer-installation/{app,bin,Plugins,vendor,composer.json,shopware.php} ./
mv composer-installation/.env.example ./.env
```

The directories `custom`, `files`, `media`, `themes`, `var` and `web` are equal with the composer installation so we can still use them and don't lose our files, plugins and themes. If you have plugins in `engine/Shopware/Plugins/Community` or `engine/Shopware/Plugins/Local` they must be moved to ```./Plugins```!

After that we should reduce the .env file. Please use your database credentials from your `config.php`. If you have further config settings there move them to `app/config/config.php` and delete the `config.php` afterwards. The `.env` file should look like the following: 

```
# Database credentials
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_DATABASE=shopware
DB_USERNAME=root
DB_PASSWORD=root
DB_PORT=3306

# This variable is checked by Shopware
DATABASE_URL=mysql://${DB_USERNAME}:${DB_PASSWORD}@${DB_HOST}:${DB_PORT}/${DB_DATABASE}

# Environment
SHOPWARE_ENV="production"
```

The next step is to set your database credentials as an environment variable. An example virtual host configuration can be found bellow:

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
        ...
        SetEnv DB_USERNAME "root"
        SetEnv DB_PASSWORD "root"
        SetEnv DB_DATABASE "shopware"
        SetEnv DB_HOST "localhost"
        SetEnv DB_PORT "3306"
        SetEnv SHOPWARE_ENV "dev"
</VirtualHost>
```

The last step is to uninstall the Shopware Auto Update Plugin. If you try an update with this Plugin, it will not work correctly and harm your Installation. You can uninstall the SwagUpdate Plugin via the following command:

```bash
./bin/console sw:plugin:uninstall SwagUpdate
```

## Conclusion
The switch from classic installation to the new composer installation is not very difficult. Please use it if you want to achieve easier deployment and shopware updates. Our colleague Soner aka shyim develops an extension for the composer project to handle community store plugins as a composer dependency.
