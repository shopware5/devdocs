## Shopware 5.2

### System requirements changes

The required PHP version is now **PHP 5.6.4 or higher**. Please check your system configuration and update your PHP version if necessary. If you are using a PHP version prior to 5.6.4 there will be errors.

The required IonCube Loader version was bumped to 5.0 or higher.

### Shopping worlds

<div class="alert alert-info">
<strong>Important tasks after updating to Shopware 5.2</strong><br/>
Due the removal of the <code>masonry</code> mode, it is necessary to update the plugins <strong>Emotion Advanced</strong> and <strong>Digital Publishing</strong> to the latest version. You won't be able to open any shopping world unless you've updated the plugins. After these steps, please verify that your shopping worlds are still working and look like they should.
</div>

The shopping worlds have been refactored which results in important changes for plugin developers.

* The `masonry` mode has been replaced with a new mode called `fluid`. Both modes automatically create a pleasant user experience when viewing
a shopping world on smaller viewports than intended by the creator. Since the `masonry` jQuery plugin is no longer needed, it has been removed from the library.

* The fields and the corresponding SEO URL are now translatable.

* Landing pages are now independent from categories since they don't always have to belong to them. Instead, they can now be assigned to multiple subshop's or language shop's, which makes it possible to generate individual SEO urls per shop. Therefore, category teaser images are no longer necessary and have been removed.

* To enable your widgets to be translatable, make sure to set the value in `s_library_component_field`.`translatable` to `1`.

* Every element now has its own viewport settings which are saved in `s_emotion_element_viewports`. These settings include position and visibility for each viewport.

* You can define a default config for each custom widget. This can include settings like maximal height, maximal width or an icon. For more information, refer to the base file in `themes/Backend/ExtJs/backend/emotion/view/detail/elements/base.js`.

To make overriding the widget configuration easy, there are new blocks in `widgets/emotion/index.tpl`:
* `widgets/emotion/index/attributes`
* `widgets/emotion/index/config`
* `widgets/emotion/index/element/config`


### CSRF protection

Shopware now includes CSRF protection which is enabled by default. Every ajax and form request
has to provide a CSRF token and will fail if it doesn't.

The header `X-CSRF-Token` is automatically added to every ajax request in the back- and frontend. In addition, the field `__csrf_token` will automatically be added to every frontend html form.

If you decide to disable the CSRF protection for specific controller actions, you have to implement the interface `Shopware\Components\CSRFWhitelistAware` and provide a list of actions you want to disable the protection for.
In case you want to disable the CSRF protection entirely, you can change the option `csrfProtection` in your `config.php` file. Please keep in mind that this is a potential security risk and we do not recommend to disable the CSRF protection.

To learn more about the new CSRF protection, refer to the [CSRF Protection Guide](/developers-guide/csrf-protection/).

### Display errors

The PHP configuration [`display_errors`](http://php.net/manual/en/errorfunc.configuration.php#ini.display-errors) defaults to `0` / `off` now.
This means for errors that happen early in the shopware stack no errors are shown to the user.
To show these early errors the `display_errors` configuration can be set back to `1` / `on` by adding the following to your `config.php` file:

```
'phpsettings' => [
    'display_errors' => 1,
],
```

This was changed to prevent information leakage of security sensitive data like usernames or directories in the error messages.

### Account / Registration

The account section and registration have been refactored to continue the refactoring of core classes.

* Changes to model `\Shopware\Models\Customer\Customer`
    * Added `title`, `salutation`, `firstname`, `lastname`, `defaultBillingAddress` and `defaultShippingAddress`
    * Moved `customernumber` and `birthday` from `Billing` to the `Customer`
    * Deprecated `billing` and `shipping`
        * Use `defaultBillingAddress` and `defaultShippingAddress` instead
* The register controller has been completely rewritten.
    * Uses the new service `shopware_account.register_service`
    * Methods of core class `\sAdmin` regarding the registration have been removed without substitution.
    * Templates may have been rewritten
        * For a complete list of template and event changes, refer to the [UPGRADE.md](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/5.2/UPGRADE.md).

### Address management

<div class="alert alert-info">
<strong>Important tasks after updating to Shopware 5.2</strong><br/>
Existing adresses including their attributes have been migrated into <code>s_user_addresses</code>. Please verify that all addresses have been merged completely. Addresses have been read from <code>s_user_billingaddress</code>, <code>s_user_shippingaddress</code>, <code>s_order_billingaddress</code>, <code>s_order_shippingaddress</code>.
</div>

The address management allows a customer to manage more than only one address which gets changed with every order. The customer is now able to create more address, e.g. for home and work, and use them later on in an order without loosing all existing address data. He can just change the reference to the default billing address, instead of changing it entirely.

* Shopware versions prior to 5.2 were using the tables `s_user_billingaddress` and `s_user_shippingaddress` which have now been marked as deprecated as well as their associated models `\Shopware\Models\Customer\Billing` and `\Shopware\Models\Customer\Shipping`. Their association in `\Shopware\Models\Customer\Customer` will be removed with Shopware version 5.3. Please use `s_user_addresses` and it's model `\Shopware\Models\Customer\Address` instead.
    * Changes to the new model will automatically be synchronised with the old models.
    * Changes to the old models or tables **won't** be synchronised to the new model and will be overwritten in case that the default billing or shipping address model changes.
* The new model is associated with the customer using the `$defaultBillingAddress` and `$defaultShippingAddress` properties. The associations are no longer managed by the customer which implies, that you have to use the new `shopware_account.address_service` to make changes to addresses.
* Selecting another address in the checkout results in a change of the session key `checkoutBillingAddressId` or `checkoutShippingAddressId` with the corresponding address id. After the order has been saved, the session keys will be reset.
* The customer api endpoint now uses the structure of the address model, instead of the billing or shipping model
* The checkout templates have been rewritten which results in changed and removed blocks.
    * For a complete list of template changes, refer to the [UPGRADE.md](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/5.2/UPGRADE.md).

To learn more about the new address service, refer to the [Address Management Guide](/developers-guide/address-management-guide).

### Attribute management

A new attribute management has been created to enable shop owners to create attributes in the backend without writing an own plugin or touching the database itself.

* 39 different attribute tables are now manageable using the new UI.
* Create, update and delete fields for every attribute using a simple UI.
    * Updating the attribute structure of an entity will automatically regenerate the appropriate attribute entities. You may have to reload the module to see your changes.
    * Attributes are now translatable, if defined so.
    * Attributes are now typed. Custom types can be created too.
* Nearly every module in Shopware now contains an attribute field set by default.

Please note, that the table `s_core_engine_elements` is still present, but will be ignored by the attribute system.

#### For frontend developers

New services were introduced to read and write attributes in the frontend. The most common services are `shopware_attribute.data_loader` and `shopware_attribute.data_persister`.

##### Loading attributes

To get all attributes for a specific item, you have to use the `shopware_attribute.data_loader` and provide the attribute table and the foreign key.

This example will fetch all attributes for the order with id 15.

```php
/** @var array $attributes */
$attributes = $this->get('shopware_attribute.data_loader')->load('s_order_attributes', 15);
```

If there is no attribute entry for the provided foreign key, `$attributes` will be false.

##### Saving attributes

To save the attributes back into the database, you have to use the `shopware_attribute.data_persister` and provide the data, the attribute table and the foreign key.
Non-existent attributes will be created automatically.
You don't have to strip array keys like `id` or foreign keys like `orderID` from the data as they will be removed by the service.

This example will save the fetched attribute data in `$attributes` from above back to the database.

```php
$this->get('shopware_attribute.data_persister')->persist($attributes, 's_order_attributes', 152);
```

In case there went something wrong, you'll get an exception.

#### For backend developers

The most common implementation is the `Shopware.attribute.Form` component that is loaded in all backend modules in order to display attributes.
There are also components for a grid or button. All components regarding attributes can be found in `themes/backend/base/attribute`.

##### Implement the Shopware.attribute.Form component

In order to implement the form component, you have to create a new instance of `Shopware.attribute.Form` and provide at least the attribute table.

This example will implement the attribute form for orders.

```js
var attributeForm = Ext.create('Shopware.attribute.Form', {
    table: 's_order_attributes'
});
```

You now have to add the `attributeForm` to your window or another existing component. To enable translation for the fields, you have to set `translatable` to  `true`. Refer to the readme file below to see all available options.

After adding the component, you are ready to load the data.

##### Loading attributes

To load the attributes into an attribute component, you have to call `loadAttribute()` and provide the foreign key.

```js
// loading attributes with a static foreign key
attributeForm.loadAttribute(5);

// or using a record
attributeForm.loadAttribute(record.get('id'));
```

This call will send a new request which loads all attributes for this item.

You can also provide a callback method which will be called after the request has been completed.

```js
attributeForm.loadAttribute(record.get('id'), function () {
    alert('attributes have been loaded!');
});
```

##### Saving attributes

Saving the attributes back to the database is almost the same as reading them. You just have to call `saveAttribute()` on the form component and provide the foreign key.

```js
// loading attributes with a static foreign key
attributeForm.saveAttribute(5);

// or using a record
attributeForm.saveAttribute(record.get('id'));
```

You can also provide a callback method which will be called after the request has been completed.

```js
attributeForm.saveAttribute(record.get('id'), function (successful) {
    if (successful) {
        alert('attributes were save successfully!');
    } else {
        alert('attributes were not saved');
    }
});
```

This call will send a new request which saves all attributes for this item.

To learn more about the new attribute management, refer to the [README.md](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/5.2/engine/Shopware/Bundle/AttributeBundle/README.md) file in the source code.

## Shopware 5.1

### System requirements changes

Shopware 5.1 is the last Shopware minor release to support PHP 5.4. The following minor release of Shopware will require PHP 5.5+. Furthermore, as of 15/09/2015, PHP 5.4 will no longer receive security updates. For these reasons, we highly recommend that you update your PHP version to the latest stable version.

The full system requirement list for Shopware 5.1 is the same as in Shopware 5.0, and can be found [here](/sysadmins-guide/system-requirements/ "Shopware system requirements").

### PHP 7 compatibility

Shopware 5.1 also introduces PHP 7.0 compatibility. This new PHP version introduces several internal changes to PHP itself, which result in greatly improved performance when compared to PHP 5.x. However, at the time of Shopware 5.1 release, PHP 7.0 was still in Release Candidate phase. As with all software major version release, we highly recommend that you do not upgrade your production environment until a final, stable version is released.

As PHP 7 introduces significant performance improvements, we expect it to be quickly adopted by our community. Therefore, we recommend that you ensure that your plugins are compatible with PHP 7. In [this link](http://php.net/manual/en/migration70.php), you will find the official migration manual, detailing all changes made to PHP 7. In particular, we expect the [new error handling](http://php.net/manual/en/migration70.incompatible.php#migration70.incompatible.error-handling) to require changes in a significant number of plugins in order to ensure compatibility. If you are using PHP 5.x, you can emulate the new error handling behaviour in Shopware by changing your `config.php` file:

```
<?php
return array (
    // other config values
    'errorHandler' => [
        'throwOnRecoverableError' => true,
    ]
);
```

Please keep in mind that changing this setting might cause PHP to throw exceptions in processes that would otherwise work flawlessly. We strongly advice that you do not enable this setting in production environments without prior thorough testing in a development environment.

Also, using this setting in PHP 5.x only emulates one of the many changes done in PHP 7. Be sure to fully test your plugins in a native PHP 7 environment to ensure their full compatibility.


### JavaScript events

* All JavaScript plugins now have `sw` prepended to their name.
* All event names have `on` prepended to them

As such, old calls, like the following:

```
$.subscribe('plugin/lightbox/init', function(arg1, arg2) {...});
```

should now be implemented like so:

```
$.subscribe('plugin/swLightbox/onInit', function(argArray) {...});
```

If your plugin publishes events, you now have the possibility to pass multiple arguments in your events. So the old syntax

```
$.publish('plugin/swPluginname/onEventname', [ me ]);
```

can now be extended to use more arguments:

```
$.publish('plugin/swPluginname/onEventname', [ me, example, test ]);
```

### AJAX Variants

Detail pages for variant articles now load new variant data via AJAX, instead of the previous full page reload. This feature is optional and enabled by default. You can disable it in your theme settings, in which case existing plugins should work as before.

The AJAX call uses the same backend controller and action as the normal HTTP call. It also renders the same template file, so most plugins should remain compatible with the new feature. However, some JavaScript customizations might require that you use the new event, which is triggered once the AJAX loading for a variant returns:

```
$.subscribe('plugin/swAjaxVariant/onRequestData', function() {
    StateManager.addPlugin('*[data-image-slider="true"]', 'swImageSlider', { touchControls: true })
});
```

Moreover, if your custom JavaScript plugin is initialized outside of the `product--detail-upper` element, it will not be automatically reinitialized after the new content is loaded. Also, due to the way in which our plugin handler is built, you cannot reinitialize plugins multiple times on the same element. As such, you need to explicitly destroy the plugin instance prior to the AJAX call, and reinitialize it after the loading process is finished.

```
$.subscribe('plugin/swAjaxVariant/onBeforeRequestData', function() {
    $('body').data('plugin_swagCustomPlugin').destroy()
});

$.subscribe('plugin/swAjaxVariant/onRequestData', function() {
    $('body').swagCustomPlugin();
});
```

### Media Service

Shopware 5.1 includes a new media management layer, which abstracts the location of your media files. Existing file paths like `media/image/my-item.png` should now be considered virtual paths. This applies to both new and existing installations, and there is no possibility to revert to the old behaviour.

If you are upgrading from Shopware 5.0 or previous, the actual media files will be automatically moved by Shopware from the old to the new path when they are first handled by the media service (i.e. displayed in the frontend, after the upgrade). This process will move the files from their current location (i.e. `media/image/my-item.png`) to a new, semi-random location (i.e. `/media/image/5c/d1/af/my-item.png`). Reverting this process is not supported, as Shopware will always move files to the new locations when needed (even if you manually move them back). If you wish, you can also use the `sw:media:migrate` CLI command to migrate all files at once, in order to avoid the migration performance penalty in the frontend.

#### For backend developers

Like mentioned before, if your server-side code manipulates media files, you will probably need to do a few changes to it. The `shopware_media.media_service` is responsible for retrieving the real path of a file based on its virtual path. You should also use it if you need to perform any other CRUD operation on media files in your custom code. The service implements methods that will allow you to perform these operations.

Suppose your custom controller has the following code:

```
$media = $this->getMedia($id);
$mediaPath = $media->getPath();
$this->View()->assign(array(
    'mediaPath' => $mediaPath
));
```

You now need to use the `shopware_media.media_service` to retrieve the actual file path for your media file:

```
$media = $this->getMedia($id);
$mediaPath = $media->getPath();

// You can access the container outside of a controller using Shopware()->Container();
$mediaService = $this->get('shopware_media.media_service');
$mediaPath = $mediaService->getUrl($mediaPath);
// the new path might look like this: "http://www.shop.com/media/image/5c/d1/af/my-fancy-image.png";

$this->View()->assign(array(
    'mediaPath' => $mediaPath
));
```

As you can see, the previous media file path is still useful. However, instead of directly, it is used internally by the `shopware_media.media_service` to retrieve the actual file path. You should adapt your custom code to fit this new logic.

The media management API also includes a path normalizer that can be used, for example, when handling media file upload to the server. In this scenario, you need to get a virtual and normalized path to the file you just uploaded. You can do so like this:

```
$fullMediaPath = 'http//www.shop.com/media/image/my-fancy-image.png'
$mediaService = $container->get('shopware_media.media_service');
$normalizedPath = $mediaService->normalize($fullMediaPath); // media/image/my-fancy-image.png
```

#### For frontend developers

Should your template or JavaScript files somehow manipulate the file path of a media entity, you should refactor your code so that this kind of logic is handled by the `shopware_media.media_service`, during server logic execution. The media service should be the exclusive responsible for determining the real path to a media file, and any external change to it might result in broken paths to files. Ensure that your code meets this standard to prevent issues when handling media files, now and in the future.

##### New Smarty Tag

In addition to the PHP functionality, we have created a new Smarty tag for generating the real path to the media file. For example, you can use it as a value for the `src` attribute of an `<img />` like seen below:

```php
<img src="{media path='media/image/my-fancy-image.png'}" />
```

#### Garbage Collector

To find unused media files, we created the `GarbageCollector` which searches through all Shopware core tables to identify unused media files.

As a plugin developer, you may have created new tables and established a relation to a media file. In case of that, you have to register your tables to the `GarbageCollector`. First, subscribe to the `Shopware_Collect_MediaPositions` event and add your tables to an `ArrayCollection`.

```php
public function install()
{
	[...]
	$this->subscribeEvent('Shopware_Collect_MediaPositions', 'onCollect');
	[...]
}

public function onCollect() {
    return new ArrayCollection([
        new \Shopware\Bundle\MediaBundle\Struct\MediaPosition('my_plugin_table', 'mediaID'),
		new \Shopware\Bundle\MediaBundle\Struct\MediaPosition('my_other_plugin_table', 'mediaPath', 'path');
		new \Shopware\Bundle\MediaBundle\Struct\MediaPosition('s_core_templates_config_values', 'value', 'path', MediaPosition::TYPE_SERIALIZE),
    ]);
}

```

The `MediaPosition` requires 2 parameters - a database table and the column which holds the relation to the `s_media` table. The third and fourth parameters are optional.

The **third** parameter selects the `s_media` column you are referencing to. The default value is `id` and can be replaced to any column in the `s_media` table like seen above. The **fourth** parameter sets the type of the value. e.g. json string. Available types are:


| Constant | Description |
|----------|----------|
| TYPE_PLAIN  |  *(Default)* Uses the plain value |
| TYPE_JSON | Decodes the value, parses json and iterates through an object or an array of objects |
| TYPE_HTML | Searches for `<img />` tags then parses and normalizes the `src` attribute |
| TYPE_SERIALIZE | Unserializes the value |

## Shopware 5.0

### Checking the Shopware version
Important: Please try to modify your plugin so that it is compatible with both 4.3 and 5
You can use the following code in your plugin:
```
if ($this->assertMinimumVersion('5')) {
    // new code
} else {
    // old code
}
```

### End of support and system requirements
We changed some of the system requirements for the new version.
Beside the known requirements which you can find [here](http://www.shopware.com/software/overview/system-requirements "Shopware system requirements") there are the following new ones:

#### PHP 5.3
PHP 5.3 is no longer supported in Shopware 5. It's recommend to use the latest stable version of PHP. Please keep in mind that PHP 5.4 will soon reach end of life, and support for it may end before the release of the next major version. For performance and compatibility reasons, we recommend using PHP 5.6.

#### Internet Explorer 8
The new responsive template is not supported in Internet Explorer 8 and below. The old emotion template still supports Internet Explorer 7 and above.

#### MySQL 5.1
MySQL 5.1 is no longer supported in Shopware 5. The required Version of MySQL for Shopware 5 is 5.5 or above.

#### IonCube Loader
IonCube Loader requirement has been upped to version 4.6.0. Notice that you only need the IonCube Loader if you are using plugins from the Shopware Store.

### Major Breaks
* `Street number` data was moved into the `Street`field
    * The existing `Street` fields were enlarged and the existing information of the `Street number` fields was appended to them.
    * The `Street number` field was removed from all template files
    * The API will still accept writes to `Street number` field, but will internally append it to the `Street` field. Read operations will no longer have `Street number` values.
* The `default` template was merged into the `emotion` template. The `default` template is was deleted.
* The Filter in the listings are now using the new core classes and the new struct objects.
* The structure of the thumbnail images has been changed.
If you are installing the new Shopware version or if you update and still want to use the  `emotion` template you don't have to do anything.
But if you are updating to Shopware 5 and you want to use the new template you have to define and generate the following new thumbnails sizes in the media manager:

    Album          | Thumbnail sizes
    -------------- | ---------------------------------------------
    Einkaufswelten | 800x800 1280x1280 1920x1920
    Banner         | 800x800 1280x1280 1920x1920
    Artikel        | 200x200 600x600 1280x1280
    Blog           | 200x200 600x600 1280x1280

For this operation we recommend the console command `sw:thumbnail:generate` to avoid timeout problems.

* The former `MultiEdit` plugin was merged into the Shopware core.
    * Plugins hooking the `ArticleList` controller or extending the `ArticleList` backend module should be reviewed
* Refactored price surcharge for variants
    * `s_article_configurator_price_surcharges` database table was fully restructured and renamed to `s_article_configurator_price_variations`. Existing data is migrated on update
    * Existing related ExtJs classes and events removed
    * Existing price variation backend controller actions and methods removed
    * `Shopware\Models\Article\Configurator\PriceSurcharged` replaced by `Shopware\Models\Article\Configurator\PriceVariation`
* The new Shopware core selects all required data for `sGetArticleById`, `sGetPromotionById` and `sGetArticlesByCategory`. Several internal methods and events are no longer used by those functions.
* Moved `engine/core/class/*` to `engine/Shopware/Core/*`
* Renamed `ENV` to `SHOPWARE_ENV` to avoid accidentally set `ENV` variable, please update your .htaccess if you use a custom envirenment or you are using the staging plugin
* All downloaded dummy plugins are now installed in the engine/Shopware/Plugins/Community directory.
* Replaced `orderbydefault` configuration by `defaultListingSorting`. The `orderbydefault` configuration worked with a plain sql input which is no longer possible. The `defaultListingSorting` contains now one of the default `sSort` parameters of a listing. If you want to reintegrate your old statement you can simple create a small plugin. You can find more information [here.](/developers-guide/shopware-5-search-bundle/)
