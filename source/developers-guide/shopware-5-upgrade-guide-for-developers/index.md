## General

In this document, developers will find details about changes made in the different Shopware 5 minor releases.

This document only covers the main changes done in each version. For a comprehensive change list of all Shopware versions,
including minor and bugfix releases, refer to the `upgrade.md` file found in your Shopware installation.


# Shopware 5.1

## System requirements changes

Shopware 5.1 is the last Shopware minor release to support PHP 5.4. The following minor release of Shopware will require PHP 5.5+. Furthermore, as of 15/09/2015, PHP 5.4 will no longer receive security updates. For these reasons, we highly recommend that you update your PHP version to the latest stable version.

The full system requirement list for Shopware 5.1 is the same as in Shopware 5.0, and can be found [here](/sysadmins-guide/system-requirements/ "Shopware system requirements").

## PHP 7 compatibility

Shopware 5.1 also introduces PHP 7.0 compatibility. This new PHP version introduces several internal changes to PHP itself, which result in greatly improved performance when compared to PHP 5.x. However, at the time of Shopware 5.1 release, PHP 7.0 was still in Release Candidate phase. As with all software major version release, we highly recommend that you do not upgrade your production environment until a final, stable version is released.

As PHP 7 introduces significant performance improvements, we expect it to be quickly adopted by our community. Therefore, we recommend that you ensure that your plugins are compatible with PHP 7. In [this link](http://php.net/manual/en/migration70.php), you will find the official migration manual, detailing all changes made to PHP 7. In particular, we expect the [new error handling](http://php.net/manual/en/migration70.incompatible.php#migration70.incompatible.error-handling) to require changes in a significant number of plugins in order to ensure compatibility. If you are using PHP 5.x, you can emulate the new error handling behaviour in Shopware by changing your `config.php` file:

```
<?php
return array (
    // other config values
    'errorHandler' => [
        'throwOnRecoverableError' => true,
    ]
);
```

Please keep in mind that changing this setting might cause PHP to throw exceptions in processes that would otherwise work flawlessly. We strongly advice that you do not enable this setting in production environments without prior thorough testing in a development environment.
  
Also, using this setting in PHP 5.x only emulates one of the many changes done in PHP 7. Be sure to fully test your plugins in a native PHP 7 environment to ensure their full compatibility. 


## JavaScript events

* All JavaScript plugins now have `sw` prepended to their name. 
* All event names have `on` prepended to them

As such, old calls, like the following:

```
$.subscribe('plugin/lightbox/init', function(arg1, arg2) {...});
```

should now be implemented like so:

```
$.subscribe('plugin/swLightbox/onInit', function(argArray) {...});
```

If your plugin publishes events, you now have the possibility to pass multiple arguments in your events. So the old syntax

```
$.publish('plugin/swPluginname/onEventname', [ me ]);
```

can now be extended to use more arguments:

```
$.publish('plugin/swPluginname/onEventname', [ me, example, test ]);
```

## AJAX Variants

Detail pages for variant articles now load new variant data via AJAX, instead of the previous full page reload. This feature is optional and enabled by default. You can disable it in your theme settings, in which case existing plugins should work as before.

The AJAX call uses the same backend controller and action as the normal HTTP call. It also renders the same template file, so most plugins should remain compatible with the new feature. However, some JavaScript customizations might require that you use the new event, which is triggered once the AJAX loading for a variant returns:

```
$.subscribe('plugin/swAjaxVariant/onRequestData', function() {
    StateManager.addPlugin('*[data-image-slider="true"]', 'swImageSlider', { touchControls: true })
});
```

Moreover, if your custom JavaScript plugin is initialized outside of the `product--detail-upper` element, it will not be automatically reinitialized after the new content is loaded. Also, due to the way in which our plugin handler is built, you cannot reinitialize plugins multiple times on the same element. As such, you need to explicitly destroy the plugin instance prior to the AJAX call, and reinitialize it after the loading process is finished.
 
```
$.subscribe('plugin/swAjaxVariant/onBeforeRequestData', function() {
    $('body').data('plugin_swagCustomPlugin').destroy()
});

$.subscribe('plugin/swAjaxVariant/onRequestData', function() {
    $('body').swagCustomPlugin();
});
```

## Media Service

Shopware 5.1 includes a new media management layer, which abstracts the location of your media files. Existing file paths like `media/image/my-item.png` should now be considered virtual paths. This applies to both new and existing installations, and there is no possibility to revert to the old behaviour.

If you are upgrading from Shopware 5.0 or previous, the actual media files will be automatically moved by Shopware from the old to the new path when they are first handled by the media service (i.e. displayed in the frontend, after the upgrade). This process will move the files from their current location (i.e. `media/image/my-item.png`) to a new, semi-random location (i.e. `/media/image/5c/d1/af/my-item.png`). Reverting this process is not supported, as Shopware will always move files to the new locations when needed (even if you manually move them back). If you wish, you can also use the `sw:media:migrate` CLI command to migrate all files at once, in order to avoid the migration performance penalty in the frontend.

### For backend developers

Like mentioned before, if your server-side code manipulates media files, you will probably need to do a few changes to it. The `shopware_media.media_service` is responsible for retrieving the real path of a file based on its virtual path. You should also use it if you need to perform any other CRUD operation on media files in your custom code. The service implements methods that will allow you to perform these operations.
 
Suppose your custom controller has the following code:

```
$media = $this->getMedia($id);
$mediaPath = $media->getPath();
$this->View()->assign(array(
    'mediaPath' => $mediaPath
));
```

You now need to use the `shopware_media.media_service` to retrieve the actual file path for your media file:

```
$media = $this->getMedia($id);
$mediaPath = $media->getPath();

// You can access the container outside of a controller using Shopware()->Container();
$mediaService = $this->get('shopware_media.media_service');
$mediaPath = $mediaService->getUrl($mediaPath);
// the new path might look like this: "http://www.shop.com/media/image/5c/d1/af/my-fancy-image.png";

$this->View()->assign(array(
    'mediaPath' => $mediaPath
));
```

As you can see, the previous media file path is still useful. However, instead of directly, it is used internally by the `shopware_media.media_service` to retrieve the actual file path. You should adapt your custom code to fit this new logic.

The `shopware_media.path_normalizer` service is also part of the new media management API, and can be used, for example, when handling media file upload to the server. In this scenario, you need to get a virtual, normalized path to the file you just uploaded, so that it can be later used in conjunction with the `shopware_media.media_service`. You can do so like this:

```
$fullMediaPath = 'http//www.shop.com/media/image/my-fancy-image.png'
$pathNormalizer = $this->get('shopware_media.path_normalizer');
$normalizedFilePath = $pathNormalizer->get($fullMediaPath); // /media/image/my-fancy-image.png
```

### For frontend developers

Should your template or JavaScript files somehow manipulate the file path of a media entity, you should refactor your code so that this kind of logic is handled by the `shopware_media.media_service`, during server logic execution. The media service should be the exclusive responsible for determining the real path to a media file, and any external change to it might result in broken paths to files. Ensure that your code meets this standard to prevent issues when handling media files, now and in the future.

# Shopware 5.0

## Checking the Shopware version
Important: Please try to modify your plugin so that it is compatible with both 4.3 and 5
You can use the following code in your plugin:
```
if ($this->assertMinimumVersion('5')) {
    // new code
} else {
    // old code
}
```

## End of support and system requirements
We changed some of the system requirements for the new version.
Beside the known requirements which you can find [here](http://www.shopware.com/software/overview/system-requirements "Shopware system requirements") there are the following new ones:

### PHP 5.3
PHP 5.3 is no longer supported in Shopware 5. It's recommend to use the latest stable version of PHP. Please keep in mind that PHP 5.4 will soon reach end of life, and support for it may end before the release of the next major version. For performance and compatibility reasons, we recommend using PHP 5.6.

### Internet Explorer 8
The new responsive template is not supported in Internet Explorer 8 and below. The old emotion template still supports Internet Explorer 7 and above.

### MySQL 5.1
MySQL 5.1 is no longer supported in Shopware 5. The required Version of MySQL for Shopware 5 is 5.5 or above.

### IonCube Loader
IonCube Loader requirement has been upped to version 4.6.0. Notice that you only need the IonCube Loader if you are using plugins from the Shopware Store.

## Major Breaks
* `Street number` data was moved into the `Street`field
    * The existing `Street` fields were enlarged and the existing information of the `Street number` fields was appended to them.
    * The `Street number` field was removed from all template files
    * The API will still accept writes to `Street number` field, but will internally append it to the `Street` field. Read operations will no longer have `Street number` values.
* The `default` template was merged into the `emotion` template. The `default` template is was deleted.
* The Filter in the listings are now using the new core classes and the new struct objects.
* The structure of the thumbnail images has been changed.
If you are installing the new Shopware version or if you update and still want to use the  `emotion` template you don't have to do anything.
But if you are updating to Shopware 5 and you want to use the new template you have to define and generate the following new thumbnails sizes in the media manager:

    Album          | Thumbnail sizes
    -------------- | ---------------------------------------------
    Einkaufswelten | 800x800 1280x1280 1920x1920
    Banner         | 800x800 1280x1280 1920x1920
    Artikel        | 200x200 600x600 1280x1280
    Blog           | 200x200 600x600 1280x1280

For this operation we recommend the console command `sw:thumbnail:generate` to avoid timeout problems.

* The former `MultiEdit` plugin was merged into the Shopware core.
    * Plugins hooking the `ArticleList` controller or extending the `ArticleList` backend module should be reviewed
* Refactored price surcharge for variants
    * `s_article_configurator_price_surcharges` database table was fully restructured and renamed to `s_article_configurator_price_variations`. Existing data is migrated on update
    * Existing related ExtJs classes and events removed
    * Existing price variation backend controller actions and methods removed
    * `Shopware\Models\Article\Configurator\PriceSurcharged` replaced by `Shopware\Models\Article\Configurator\PriceVariation`
* The new Shopware core selects all required data for `sGetArticleById`, `sGetPromotionById` and `sGetArticlesByCategory`. Several internal methods and events are no longer used by those functions.
* Moved `engine/core/class/*` to `engine/Shopware/Core/*`
* Renamed `ENV` to `SHOPWARE_ENV` to avoid accidentally set `ENV` variable, please update your .htaccess if you use a custom envirenment or you are using the staging plugin
* All downloaded dummy plugins are now installed in the engine/Shopware/Plugins/Community directory.
* Replaced `orderbydefault` configuration by `defaultListingSorting`. The `orderbydefault` configuration worked with a plain sql input which is no longer possible. The `defaultListingSorting` contains now one of the default `sSort` parameters of a listing. If you want to reintegrate your old statement you can simple create a small plugin. You can find more information [here.](/developers-guide/shopware-5-search-bundle/)
