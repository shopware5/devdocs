        <h1 class="landingpage--headline">The new Shopware universe</h1>

        <p class="hero--text">We have been intensively researching what a new software foundation must offer in order to successfully shape the future of online retail. It must be as individually adaptable as we human beings are. The resulting solutions should automate as far as possible, and must offer customers an excitingly staged product experience.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="hero--text">This product vision has given rise to a new technological basis with a completely redeveloped and state-of-the-art core that consistently follows the API-first approach. Another important component is a new, flexible and modern administration interface that makes daily work all the more enjoyable. You can watch the initial results of our development here.</p>
