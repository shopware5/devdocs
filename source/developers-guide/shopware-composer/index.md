## Introduction

Starting with v5.4 Shopware supports installing a shop as a [Composer dependency](https://github.com/shopware/composer-project)
out of the box. This helps you to professionalize development and deployments of Shopware shops by providing a reliable
versioning of Shopware itself and all the plugins required by your project.

## What is Composer

Composer defines itself as "[...] a tool for dependency management in PHP. It allows you to declare the libraries
your project depends on and it will manage (install/update) them for you" ([Composer website](https://getcomposer.org/)).

Composer is the de-facto-standard for dependency management in the PHP community. You can think of it as the
apt/yum/npm/brew of the PHP world.

## How to start

To create a new Shopware project with Shopware as a dependency, all you need to do is install Composer
([download it here](https://getcomposer.org/download/) if you haven't yet) and run

```bash
composer create-project shopware/composer-project my_project_name --no-interaction --stability=dev
```

This will clone the project repository with all necessary dependencies (including the latest released Shopware version)
into a new directory `my_project_name`. Shopware itself will be deployed under `vendor/shopware/shopware` like any other
dependency you might require later on.

## Configuring Shopware

The Composer Shopware project template relies on environment variables to configure your Shopware project. You can
either set those directly (this is recommended on production environments e.g. to not store credentials on disk) or
using a `.env` file in the project root. To see which variables are supported, have a look at the `.env.example` file.

You can also have a `.env` file created for you! Simply run `app/install.sh` inside your new project directory to have a
little installer-script ask you all necessary information.

If you need to configure other values in the `config.php` (e.g. the error or session handler), you can find the file in 
the `app/config/` directory.

## Requiring plugins

Given you want to require the SwagMediaSftp-plugin, all you need to do is run

```bash
composer require shopwarelabs/swag-media-sftp:1.0.1
```

This will add the plugin to your composer.json, download it and install it into the appropriate folder `custom/plugins`.
All you need to do afterwards is install and enable it in the Shopware backend.

Composer knows where to install the plugin to because of the `type` defined in the `composer.json` of this plugin. For
a complete list of available types, see [Composer Installers](https://github.com/composer/installers).

## Project specific plugins

The path `custom/plugins` and all the old plugin directories were added to the `.gitignore` file to prevent plugins
required via Composer from being version controlled in the new project repository as well. We recommend to use Github
or some on-premise Git hosting solution to share plugins you use in more than one Shopware project between those shops.
You can then require those plugins in any of your shops using a Composer command like the one above.

In case you want to create a project specific plugin which doesn't need to be shared, you can install it into the
`custom/project` directory. This directory is equivalent to `custom/plugins`, the only difference is that plugins added
here are version controlled together with the project. There is no equivalent alternative to the old-style plugin
directories, only 5.2 project specific plugins are supported out of the box. Of course you can modify your `.gitignore`-
file, but in that case you should add all plugins you might require via Composer into it.

## Upgrading Shopware

Update the version number of `shopware/shopware` in the `composer.json`, e.g. from `5.4.0` to `5.4.1` after this version
has been released:
```json
    "require": {
        "shopware/shopware": "5.4.1",
        ...
```
Then run `composer update shopware/shopware` to have Composer update the installed version of Shopware to the new version.
Do not forget to commit the new `composer.lock` file to your project afterwards.

Currently every `composer update` triggers a `bin/console sw:migration:migrate` since it would be possible that
Shopware itself got updated and need a new schema version to run properly. If you want to disable this behaviour you can
remove the `post-update-cmd` hook in the `composer.json` or modify the `app/post-update.sh` according to your needs.

<div class="alert alert-info">
Though it is possible to define a more lax version constraint of a depedency in the `composer.json` (e.e.g `@stable` 
to get the latest release or `^5.4` to get the latest release of the 5.4 minor version, 
[see Composer documentation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/versions.md) for details) it is nevertheless 
recommended to define a specific, fixed version to not update by accident. 
</div>

## Upgrading plugins

### Upgrade project specific plugins

As the code of project specific plugins (under `/custom/project/`) are part of your projects repository, these plugins
will always have the version that was committed with the version of your project you have checked out currently.

### Upgrade required, external plugins

If you want to upgrade (or downgrade) a plugin you required as described in `Requiring plugins` you can do it the same
way you upgrade Shopware itself: You change the version number specified in the `composer.json` and do a `composer update`
afterwards.

If for example the plugin `shopwarelabs/swag-media-sftp` was to release a version `1.1.0` you would change this version
in the `composer.json`:
```json
    "require": {
        ...
        "shopwarelabs/swag-media-sftp": "1.1.0",
        ...
```

Afterwards you run `composer update shopwarelabs/swag-media-sftp` to have Composer check for the new version and commit
the updated `composer.lock` file to your version control software.

<div class="alert alert-info">
Please be aware that this only updates the source code of the plugins, it does not run any update-handlers this plugin 
might contain (e.g. to upgrade some plugin-specific tables).
</div>

To let the plugin update itself, it is a good practice to run the following command to let the plugin update it's own
internal state to the new version: 

```bash
bin/console sw:plugin:update <plugin-name>
```
