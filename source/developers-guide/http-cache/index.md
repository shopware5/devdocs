Caching is a common approach to improve the scalability of a system. For that reason, Shopware provides a build in
HTTP cache, that should be enabled in production systems. This document will handle some basics regarding
configuration and debugging of the HTTP cache.


<div class="toc-list" data-depth="3"></div>

## Configuring the cache
The cache configuration consists of two parts: The backend configuration, which will allow
you to modify the caching behaviour from within Shopware, and the base configuration, which is
configured in your `config.php` file.

### Backend
The cache configuration module can be found in `Settings`->`Caches / Performance`->`Settings`->`Http-Cache`.

![Cache backend config](/developers-guide/http-cache/img/cache-backend-module.png)

It mainly has the following configuration options:

* Activate HTTP Cache: Turn the HTTP caching on or off
* [Automatic cache invalidation](/blog/2015/02/11/understanding-the-shopware-http-cache/#cache-invalidation-ids): If an item X is changed, clear the caches for pages which contain X.
This is highly recommended, as this will allow you to have full cached pages AND almost instant
cache updates, if e.g. the price of an item changes.
* Alternate proxy URL: When not using Shopware built in cache, enter the IP of your cache here. This
will allow you to invalidate / clear your remote cache from within Shopware.
* Admin view: Do not cache frontend pages if you are signed in as an admin.
* [Cache controller times](/blog/2015/02/11/understanding-the-shopware-http-cache/#whitelisted-controllers): Which
controller should be cached for how long? The `Controller` column contains the controller's module + the controller's name.
The `time` column the caching time in seconds (TTL). Only controllers / pages in this will be cached at all.
* [Controller tags not to be cached](/blog/2015/02/11/understanding-the-shopware-http-cache/#nocache-tags): Do
not cache these controllers if the user session has a certain state. The rule of thumb is: if a user is logged in, the
`price` tag is active, if some items are in the cart or the `checkout` tag is active. So, as you can see, Shopware will not
cache listing pages of logged in users - they might have different prices. See the link before for more details.


### Config
As always, the basic config definition can be found in `engine/Shopware/Configs/Default.php`.
Here you'll find the basic definitions, which can be overridden from your `config.php` file.
Depending on your Shopware version, it will look like this:

```
'httpcache' => [
    'enabled' => true,
    'cache_dir' => $this->getCacheDir().'/html',
    'cache_cookies' => ['shop', 'currency', 'x-cache-context-hash'],
    'debug' => false,
    'default_ttl' => 0,
    'private_headers' => ['Authorization', 'Cookie'],
    'allow_reload' => false,
    'allow_revalidate' => false,
    'stale_while_revalidate' => 2,
    'stale_if_error' => false
]
```

Some of the fields are Shopware specific:

* `enabled`: If you want to use Shopware's builtin cache (a.k.a `reverse proxy`), this needs
to be set to `true`. If you are using a Varnish cache, you need to set this config to `false`.
* `cache_dir`: The cache files will be stored in this directory.
* `cache_cookies`: The content of these cookies is taken into account in the cacheID - so
e.g. there will be a different cache for "shop=1" and "shop=2". We will discuss this in depth later.

The other fields will influence the underlying Symfony HTTP cache component, so these config
values are described in the [Symfony HTTP cache documentation](http://symfony.com/doc/current/book/http_cache.html).
Just as an overview:

* `debug`: Will set some additional debugging info in the cache's responses. This will be explained later in this document
* `default_ttl`: How long is a page considered to be fresh before the cache will try to get
a fresh result? Usually this config is overridden by the TTL definition you made in the backend module.
* `private_headers`: A list of headers that will make the cache *not* cache the result. By default
pages with Authorisation headers and "set cookie" responses will not be cached
* `allow_reload`: Will allow a client to bypass the cache by providing specific headers.
* `allow_revalidate`: Will allow a client to bypass the cache by setting another header.
* `stale_while_revalidate` and `stale_if_error` will allow the cache to request fresh pages in
certain conditions

## Debugging the cache
The internal behaviour of the cache is usually not exposed to the end user. So it's hard to tell if ESI subrequests
came live from the server or if the page has been cached at all.

### The debug flag

Setting the debug flag in your `config.php` will expose this info for debugging purposes:

```
'httpcache' => [
    'debug' => true,
],
```

After clearing the shop's cache, open the developer toolbar of your browser and look at the document's response headers:

```
X-Content-Digest:en1dac22cb10b9a66cb6590a7819384d54fcb637e838f65c40b655b07c85cd5f7d
X-Shopware-Allow-Nocache:price-1
X-Shopware-Cache-Id:;c3;
X-Symfony-Cache: GET /: miss, store;
    GET /?action=shopMenu&controller=index&module=widgets: fresh;
    GET /?controller=compare&module=widgets: miss, store;
    GET /?action=menu&controller=index&group=gLeft&module=widgets: miss, store;
    GET /?action=info&controller=checkout&module=widgets: miss, store
```

The `X-Content-Digest` header gives you information of the cached file - you could actually inspect the file by opening
`/your/doc/root/var/cache/production____REVISION___/html/en/1d/ac/22cb10b9a66cb6590a7819384d54fcb637e838f65c40b655b07c85cd5f7d`.
So the first 6 chars describe the directory, the rest of the content digest is the file name.

`X-Shopware-Allow-Nocache` will tell which `nocache` tags the current page reacts to. In the given case,
the `index` controller was called, which will not be cached if the `price` tag is active. The suffixed `-1` indicates that the current
shop has ID `1`.

`X-Shopware-Cache-Id` contains a list of semicolon separated cache IDs. In this case, `c3` indicates that the cache for
this page should be invalidated if the category with ID 3 is changed. See [this page](/blog/2015/02/11/understanding-the-shopware-http-cache/#cache-invalidation-ids)
for additional info. The cache ID can be manipulated using the `Shopware_Plugins_HttpCache_InvalidateCacheId` event
as described [here](/blog/2015/02/11/understanding-the-shopware-http-cache/#cache-for-plugin-developers).

`X-Symfony-Cache` tells you which pages have been requested by the cache. This will be the
main request (`/` in this case) as well as all the ESI requests (beginning with `/?` in this case).
As you can see, there were 4 ESI requests in this case. In addition to that, we can also see which requests hit
the cache (`fresh`) and which requests had to be requested from Shopware (`miss`). In the example above, most
 requests missed the cache and were fetched from Shopware - but were stored (`store`) afterwards.

The combination of these headers is quite valuable if you want to improve your cache performance even more, or if you
need to debug the cache invalidation behaviour. In addition to that, it tells you how many ESI requests have been made -
usually having too many ESI requests will lower your cache performance.

### Debugging other headers
There are other headers like `Cache-Control`, `Age` or `Pragma` that might be useful when making assumptions regarding
the cache. These, however, are usually not a good indicator for what actually happened: Shopware uses the `Cache-Control` header,
for example, to tell the HTTP cache / reverse proxy if it should cache the response. The Symfony HTTP cache, as well
as our [Varnish configuration](/sysadmins-guide/varnish-setup/), will modify this header in many cases, in order to prevent other proxies or the user
agent from additionally caching the response. So even if Shopware internally sets the `Cache-Control` header to a value
like `Cache-Control', 'public, max-age=3600, s-maxage=3600` as configured in the cache backend module, the
actual caching instance might still decide to set another header to prevent double cached content.

Similar behaviour is applied to the `Age` header, which might be stripped by e.g. your web server.

## Live caching
Caching and live results are mutually exclusive, of course. But there are several techniques to fetch live results even
for cached pages or control the cache IDs in a way that is more suitable for your use case.

### Action tag
Shopware's `action` tag is quite powerful and will work for cached shops as well as for pure live shops. It will
call another controller internally and render that controller's view into the current body. If caching is enabled,
it will render ESI tags, which are also able to bypass the cache for the given controller:

So this snippet

```
{action controller=listing action=topseller categoryId=3}
```

in one of your template files will become an ESI tag like this:

```
<esi:include src="listing/topseller?categoryId=3" alt="" onerror="continue"/>
```

As mentioned before, ESI tags are a very comfortable way to render live parts or parts with other caching times into
a cached template. You shouldn't overuse them, though - this might reduce the performance of your cache.

### Javascript
Another very common technique is embedding custom javascript into the page. This will allow you to perform e.g.
Ajax request against an (uncached) controller and gather information this way. This might especially be useful
if you want to e.g. have live in stock values for listing pages - having `action` tags for every item on the list will
reduce the cache benefit, so having one Ajax call fetching all stock info for the current item list is more performant.
The new Shopware 5 javascript plugin base is described in a [separate article](/designers-guide/javascript-statemanager-and-pluginbase/).

![image of the last viewed functionality](/developers-guide/http-cache/img/cache-viewed.png)

Generally, javascript is an elegant way to deal with full cached pages - a nice example from the Shopware standard is
the "last viewed items" functionality: as it is available on many pages (e.g. listing or detail pages), ESI tags were not
a good solution as they would still produce much load on the database for almost every page. Using javascript and
local storage, we've been able to move this function to the browser entirely.

### Cache keys
Another common approach to make the cache aware of pages that might differ depending on certain state, is to include
this state into the URL itself. As the cache uses the [request URI as part of the cache key](/blog/2015/02/11/understanding-the-shopware-http-cache/#cache-keys),
we can make the cache aware of e.g. filter options, by adding them to the URL.
![filter options are included in the URI](/developers-guide/http-cache/img/cache-uri.png)
In the screenshot above, you can see how Shopware encodes the current filter selection to the URL - so separate caches are
built for each filter combination. You can mimic this behaviour for own (cached) controllers or extend Shopware's logic for
e.g. the article detail controller to include your custom information in the URL to have separate cache keys for it.

### Cache cookie
By default, Shopware does not only use the URL as cache key, but also some cookies - currently `shop` (for the currently
selected shop), `currency` (for the currently selected currency) and `x-cache-context-hash` (which is the hash of the
tax and user group context of the current user).

You can add custom cookies to the list in your `config.php` to get better control of the cache keys:

```
'httpcache' => [
    // the other cache options are inherited from Default.php
    'cache_cookies' => ['shop', 'currency', 'x-cache-context-hash', 'my-cache-cookie'],
],
```

In this case, a cookie named `my-cache-cookie` was added. If the index page of the shop is called now, nothing has changed,
as the cookie isn't set yet. When the `debug` flag enabled, the following info will be returned:


```
X-Symfony-Cache:GET /: fresh;
x-content-digest:en90ac14335786a59216b36f019a6e8cec08475331d3d8c646bce0475c689ba119
```

So this is a cache hit with the content hash `en90ac…`.

If a cookie is set using the javascript console with the command `document.cookie="my-cache-cookie=1"` and the page is
reloaded, the following output appears:

```
X-Symfony-Cache:GET /: miss;
X-Content-Digest:en3ee31beae6fc6f9d54f5c2c5f7b714a604b357c27e44c416e684237a5eecc91b
```

As you can see, the new content hash `en3ee3…` differs from the first one. You can reproduce this behaviour again by setting the cookie
to a value `2` - and you will get another cache miss with a new content hash. If the content of the cookie is set back to
`1`, it will hit the cache again with the prior content hash `en3ee3…`.

Generally this is a quite powerful mechanism to have good control over the cache keys. As always, be aware that the
overall target of HTTP caching is to serve as many pages from the cache. The more complex your cache key is, the lower
the cache hit rate will become - so think twice before adding new cache keys.

Also, be aware that this approach only applies to Shopware's built-in reverse proxy. If you are using Varnish, you also
have to make your [Varnish configuration](/sysadmins-guide/varnish-setup/) aware of this cookie.


## Trusted Proxies
Another topic that is quite relevant for you, if you are working with bigger environments, is the [`trustedproxies`
configuration](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_foundation/trusting_proxies.html).

It does not affect the cache directly, but as soon as you have e.g. a Varnish and a load balancer in play, you will need
to deal with the fact that your IP address is replaced with e.g. the proxy's IP address. This might have effects on
various functions which check for your IP address, e.g. the "maintenance mode", which only allows users with a configured
IP to see the shop. Usually, the proxy will set a header `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` which indicates which user originally
triggered the request. Of course, Shopware cannot simply rely on this header, as headers can be spoofed easily.
The `trustedproxies` configuration defines which clients (proxies) are allowed to set the `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` header.
Headers from other IPs are ignored.

In order to configure this config, simply change your `config.php` like this:

```
<?php

return [
    'db' => [
        // your default db configuration
    ],
    'trustedproxies' => [
        192.168.0.10
    ],
]
```

In this case the proxy with the IP `192.168.0.10` is allowed to set the `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR` header.
