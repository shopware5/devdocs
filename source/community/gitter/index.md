## The shopware Gitter channel is discontinued

*It is replaced by Slack.* Please use <a href="https://slack.shopware.com">invite link</a> to connect and (re)join the awesome shopware community via chat!

The official chatroom for shopware is [shopware/shopware](https://gitter.im/shopware/shopware?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link) on `gitter.im`. 

You can find active community members and even some shopware employees there.

Please note, the main channel is used for shopware related topics and english only.

There is a separate channel for [offtopic](https://gitter.im/shopware/offtopic?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link) talk.

Because of our strong german community, for the time being there is a [german channel](https://gitter.im/shopware/shopwareDE?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link) as well.

## How to connect

Use one of the links above or choose your channel from [the overview](https://gitter.im/shopware/home). You can login using either your github or your twitter account.

If you do not want to use the website, there are Gitter [apps](https://gitter.im/apps) available as well.

Mobile users can use the [iPhone](http://appstore.com/gitter) or [android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=im.gitter.gitter) app.

## Why not IRC or Slack?
The #shopware IRC channel was active since 2011 and had quite a few regular active users. It is no longer available. The reasons for discontinuing can be found <a href="{{ site.url }}/community/irc">here</a>. 

Ultimately, we choose Gitter over slack because shopware is an open source product with git as VCS and with Gitter there is a direct connection between the chat and our repository.
The community evolves around github, so Gitter was the most integrated and easily accessible medium for a chat.
