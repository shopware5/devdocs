## Theme.php
The ```Theme.php``` is the base file of each and every theme. It provides the basic information about the author, the license and a short description for the Theme Manager. Additionally, it provides access to the following features:

- LESS compiler
- Javascript compiler
- Adding customizable options for the theme user
- Adding configuration sets

The following example shows a demo ```Theme.php``` file for a theme named "Example":

```
<?php
namespace Shopware\Themes\Example;

use Doctrine\Common\Collections\ArrayCollection;
use Shopware\Components\Form as Form;
use Shopware\Components\Theme\ConfigSet;

class Theme extends \Shopware\Components\Theme
{
	/** @var string Defines the parent theme */
	protected $extend = 'Bare';

	/** @var string Defines the human readable name */
	protected $name = 'Example';

	/** @var string Description of the theme */
	protected $description = 'An awesome Shopware theme';

	/** @var string The author of the theme */
	protected $author = 'shopware AG';

	/** @var string License of the theme */
	protected $license = 'MIT';
}
```

### Adding javascript files to your theme
Working with compressors isn't always as easy as adding the files to your HTML structure using ```script``` tags. The built-in javascript compressor is as easy as this and perfectly suited your workflow as a web developer.

Simply place your javascript files in the ```frontend/_public``` directory and add their paths to the ```$javascript``` array in your ```Theme.php```, and you're good to go.

```
/** @var array Defines the files which should be compiled by the javascript compressor */
protected $javascript = array(
	'src/js/jquery.my-plugin.js'
);
```

### Adding LESS files to your theme
The built-in LESS compiler searches for a file named ```all.less``` in the ```frontend/_public/src/less``` directory. You just have to create the necessary directory structure and your LESS code will automatically converted to CSS on the fly.

### I don't know LESS, what can I do?
You can add a ```$css``` array to your ```Theme.php``` file, similar to the ```$javascript``` array, with the paths of your CSS files:

```
/** @var array Defines the files which should be compiled by the javascript compressor */
protected $css = array(
	'src/css/my-styles.css'
);
```

## What should I know about the LESS integration?
Less is a CSS pre-processor, meaning that it extends the CSS language, adding features that allow variables, mixins, functions and many other techniques that allow you to make CSS that is more maintainable, customizable and extendable.

### Responsive adjustment with LESS
We're using relative measuring units, like ```em``` or ```rem``` throughout the code base. Working with them can be at times troublesome. To simplify the process, we include a LESS mixin called ```unitize```.

It provides the ability to create ```rem``` values with a pixel based fallback for older browser.

The following example shows how to use the mixin using a ```12px font-size```:

```
p {
	.unitize(font-size, 12);
}
```

Relative measuring units are always based on the ```font-size``` of the ```html``` element. In almost every case, the default browsers ```font-size``` is 16px and that's why the mixin uses 16 as default base value for the ```rem``` calculation. If you want to use a different base value you can simply add it as a third parameter.

## Customizing your theme
It's possible to add custom configuration options to your theme. Using this method, the user can fully customize the theme without having to edit any CSS files.

### Creating configuration elements
To create configuration elements it's necessary to add a ```createConfig()``` method to your ```Theme.php```. The method specifies the elements you need for the configuration form. The first parameter is the container element of type ```Shopware\Components\Form\Container\TabContainer``` where you can add additional fields as well as other container elements.

```
/**
 * @param Form\Container\TabContainer $container
 */
public function createConfig(Form\Container\TabContainer $container)
{

    $tab = $this->createTab(
        'responsive_colors_tab',
        'Responsive colors'
    );
    $container->addTab($tab);
}
```

#### Container elements
The ```$container``` also accepts other container elements like a tab or a fieldset.

```
/**
 * @param Form\Container\TabContainer $container
 */
public function createConfig(Form\Container\TabContainer $container)
{
    $fieldset = $this->createFieldSet(
        'responsive_fieldset',
        'My responsive settings'
    );
    $tab = $this->createTab(
        'responsive_colors_tab',
        'Responsive colors'
    );
    $tab->addElement($fieldset);

    $container->addTab($tab);
}

```

#### Adding elements to the configuration container
Now you can add the necessary elements to the ```$container```. The following elements are available:

- ```createTextField```
- ```createNumberField```
- ```createCheckboxField```
- ```createDateField```
- ```createEmField```
- ```createColorPickerField```
- ```createMediaField```
- ```createPercentField```
- ```createPixelField```
- ```createSelectField```
- ```createTextAreaField```


All elements have a similar syntax:

```
$this->createTextField([unique name], [label], [default value]);
```


In the following example we created a textfield with the label ```Basic font size``` and the name ```basic_font_size```. The name of any field is mandatory and has to be unique. It will be used to assign the value of the field to the storefront.

```
/**
 * @param Form\Container\TabContainer $container
 */
public function createConfig(Form\Container\TabContainer $container)
{
	// Create the fieldset which is the container of our field
    $fieldset = $this->createFieldSet(
        'responsive_fieldset',
        'My responsive settings'
    );

    // Create the textfield
    $textField = $this->createTextField(
    	'basic_font_size',
    	'Basic font size',
    	'16px'
    );

    $fieldset->addElement($textField);

    // Create the tab which will be named "Responsive settings"
    $tab = $this->createTab(
        'responsive_colors_tab',
        'Responsive settings'
    );

    // ...add the fieldset to the tab
    $tab->addElement($fieldset);

    // ...last but not least add the tab to the container, which is a tab panel.
    $container->addTab($tab);
}

```

After saving the ```Theme.php```, you will be able to get the value of the field in the storefront like so:

```
{$theme.basic_font_size}
```

## The "Bare" theme
We're aware that our theme is used by thousands of customers and agencies. To simplifying the process of creating your very own theme for Shopware 5, we are pleased to introduce our "Bare" theme. It's built using the latest web standards and provides a rock solid foundation which helps you build fast, robust and adaptable web shops.

### Using the "Bare" theme as a parent theme
Using the "Bare" theme as the foundation for your own theme is easy.

To modify the parent theme of your custom theme, open your ```Theme.php``` file and modify the following property:

```
<?php
namespace Shopware\Themes\Example;

use Doctrine\Common\Collections\ArrayCollection;
use Shopware\Components\Form as Form;
use Shopware\Components\Theme\ConfigSet;

class Theme extends \Shopware\Components\Theme
{
	/** @var string Defines the parent theme */
	protected $extend = 'Bare';
}
```

### Theme structure
The structure of a Shopware 5 theme is very similar to the one already existing in Shopware 4. It is still based on the available sections of Shopware, but it has been refined for easier maintaining. The new structure looks like:

```
├── documents
├── frontend
│   ├── _includes
│   ├── account
│   ├── blog
│   │   └── comment
│   ├── campaign
│   ├── checkout
│   │   └── items
│   ├── compare
│   ├── custom
│   ├── detail
│   │   ├── comment
│   │   └── tabs
│   ├── error
│   ├── forms
│   ├── home
│   ├── index
│   ├── listing
│   │   ├── actions
│   │   ├── filter
│   │   └── product-box
│   ├── newsletter
│   ├── note
│   ├── paypal
│   ├── plugins
│   │   ├── compare
│   │   ├── index
│   │   ├── notification
│   │   ├── payment
│   │   └── seo
│   ├── register
│   ├── robots_txt
│   ├── search
│   ├── sitemap
│   ├── sitemap_xml
│   └── tellafriend
├── newsletter
│   ├── alt
│   ├── container
│   └── index
└── widgets
    ├── checkout
    ├── compare
    ├── emotion
    │   └── components
    ├── index
    ├── listing
    └── recommendation
```

### Differences between the Shopware 4 and Shopware 5 structure
Shopware 5 themes, like in Shopware 4, are still divided in great sections, with multiple subsections each. In addition we've divided the template files even smaller parts to increase the reusability and maintainability.

For example, we splitted the product box template file ```box_article.tpl``` in smaller parts which can be found in the ```listing/product-box``` directory.

We've also created a new directory named ```_includes```, which contains components which are used across the whole Shopware theme.

## The "Responsive" theme
The "Responsive" theme is our new default theme in Shopware 5. It is based on the "Bare" theme and provides its styling and client side functionalities.

### Theme structure
As it's based on the "Bare" theme, the "Responsive" theme only contains the LESS and javascript files, as well as the third party libraries:

```
└── _public
    ├── src
    │   ├── css
    │   ├── fonts
    │   ├── img
    │   │   ├── icons
    │   │   └── logos
    │   ├── js
    │   │   └── vendors
    │   │       ├── modernizr
    │   │       └── raphael
    │   └── less
    │       ├── _components
    │       ├── _mixins
    │       ├── _modules
    │       └── _variables
    └── vendors
        ├── css
        │   └── pocketgrid
        ├── fonts
        │   └── open-sans-fontface
        │       ├── Bold
        │       ├── ExtraBold
        │       ├── Light
        │       ├── Regular
        │       └── Semibold
        ├── js
        │   ├── jquery
        │   ├── jquery.event.move
        │   ├── jquery.event.swipe
        │   ├── jquery.transit
        │   ├── masonry
        │   └── picturefill
        └── less
            ├── normalize-less
            └── open-sans-fontface
```

Please notice that the ```_resources``` directory was renamed to ```_public```. This directory now contains separated third-party and Shopware specific source files in its subdirectories.

The third-party libraries can now be found under ```_public/vendors``` and the Shopware specific code under ```_public/src```. 

When developing with Grunt, the third-party assets can be installed via the frontend package manager Bower, which is explained [here](/designers-guide/managing-third-party-dependencies-with-bower).
